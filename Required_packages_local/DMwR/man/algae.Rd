          \description{
            This data set contains observations on 11 variables as well
          as the concentration levels of 7 harmful algae. Values were
          measured in several European rivers. The 11 predictor
          variables include 3 contextual variables (season, size and
          speed) describing the water sample, plus 8 chemical
          concentration measurements.
